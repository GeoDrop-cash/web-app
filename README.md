# GeoDrop.cas
This is the front end code that controls [GeoDrop.Cash](https://geodrop.cash).

## Status 10/16/22 - by Chris Troutner
This app is built on top of the gatsby-ipfs-web-wallet Gatsby Theme, which has become outdated and obsolete. Some day, I'd like to resurrect this app, but will require a large rewrite. I would need to decouple the code specific for the game from the Gatsby Theme, by porting the code to a different web app, such as [bch-wallet-web3-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android).
